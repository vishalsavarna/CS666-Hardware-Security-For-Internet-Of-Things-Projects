Knowledge equivalent of CS220 and CS641

Who Can Take The Course:
PhD, Masters, 3rd and 4th year UG Students

 
Departments That May Be Interested:
CSE, EE

Course Objective
The domain of hardware security mainly covers the protection of physical device from different security threats posed by information leakage 
through covert channels, Trojan insertion, machine learning attacks, in- vasive or semi-invasion attacks etc. Even, 
secure deployment of various hardware security primitives in the untrusted environments entails several hardware and protocol level challenges. 
In this course, we will focus on the ever-increasing number of connected devices in IoT framework and analyse the impact of real world threats. 
And then, we will intro- duce various hardware security primitives for authentication and secure communication. The contents selected for the course are 
  based on research papers from top-tier journals and conferences such as IEEE TIFS, IACR TCHES, IEEE TDSC, ACM TECS, CCS, S&P, USENIX, DAC, DATE etc. 
covering advanced topics of hardware security.
